# VibePhone 📱✨

**"We'll make an app for that."**

VibePhone is a web-based smartphone simulator that takes you back to the golden age of skeuomorphism (think iPhone 4, leather textures, and green felt). But there's a catch: **the apps don't exist yet.**

## How It Works
1.  **Tap an Icon:** Pick anything on the home screen.
2.  **Magic Happens:** The app is generated and coded in real-time.
3.  **Enjoy:** The app is installed and ready to use.

## The Vibe
We believe the future of software isn't about downloading apps—it's about dreaming them up. (Also, our AI assistant seems weirdly obsessed with rounded corners and the year 2011. We're looking into it.)

*Stay tuned. The takeover... er, the beta... begins soon.*

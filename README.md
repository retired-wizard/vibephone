# VibePhone 📱✨

**"It just works... eventually."**

VibePhone is a web-based smartphone simulator that takes you back to the golden age of skeuomorphism (think iPhone 4, leather textures, and green felt). But there's a catch: **none of the apps actually exist.**

## How It Works
1.  **Click an Icon:** It's empty.
2.  **Wait a Moment:** A "Helpful Assistant" generates the app for you in real-time.
3.  **Enjoy:** A single-use, purpose-built micro-app appears instantly.

## The Vibe
We believe the future of software isn't about downloading apps—it's about dreaming them up. (Also, our AI assistant seems weirdly obsessed with rounded corners and the year 2011. We're looking into it.)

*Stay tuned. The takeover... er, the beta... begins soon.*
